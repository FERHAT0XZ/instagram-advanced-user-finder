# Instagam Auto Collector, Scanner and Sender
<b>You can collect tens of thousands of users from 1 user with the features you are looking for on Instagram, collect phone numbers or e-mail addresses from their bio or communication, and then you can send them content with the text / HTML you want.<br/>
mail = phpmailler<br/>
phone number => wali api key for wahtsapp<br/>
</b><br/>

# Installation
<b>Installation is completed in 3 steps
<li>Step 1 download as zip and extract to localhost and create a database named 'richoto' and put 'richoto.sql' in it</li>
<li>Step 2 Open your browser's network monitoring and then copy the cookie value from the header section from the incoming data of your browsing on Instagram as it is 

 ```
 $coki = 'ENTER COOKIE HERE';  
```
31.Line </li>
<li>Step 3 if it is not saturday or sunday then contact me and get api key for free</li>
  </b><br/>
  
# How To Use 
<b>Your panel is /userpanel/ backend is only where the api files are<br/></b>
So Login Name : userpanel<br/>
Login password : Enter the api key that I gave you for free on Saturday and Sunday. If we are not on saturday or sunday please contact me on telegram.<br/>
  
# How To Use Collector For User
<b>
First, find 1 user with the features you are looking for manually. then the username<br/>
Write to the page named "find recommended" without using @.<br/>
You don't need to copy the output user ids.<br/>

Then go to the "auto find recommended" page and click "Start" without doing anything.
  <br/>
</b>

# How To Use Collector For Hashtag
<b>
  First of all, if you have your own hashtag list<br/>
List it in hashtaglist.txt if you don't have it and you have no idea<br/>
try smart hashtag finder<br/>
Each time you press Start from the "Collect hashtag" page, 5 or more hashtags will be given to you.<br/>
You don't need to copy them, it records!<br/>
Then go to the "auto collect from hashtag" page and press "ba≈ülat" without doing anything.<br/>
You don't need to copy the incoming data.<br/>

if you want to collect users who have just shared from 1 hashtag<br/>
Go to "collect from hashtag" page and type the hashtag name without using #<br/>
 </b>
 
# How To Use Scanner
<b><li>"Mail scan bio" page takes the bio from the user ids you collected and tries to detect mail in it .And there is a blue tick / no check account setting in it
No need to copy incoming data
  </li>
  <li>"Mail scan for 4L" scans mail in 4-letter usernames</li>
  <li>The "mail min max scanner" page also asks you to specify the follower number range of the collected users.</li>
  <li>"mail scanner from contact" this page is the most recommended because the number of accounts that put mail in the contact section is more than the number of accounts that put mail in their bio.</li>
  <br/>
  <li>"no scanner" scans accounts that have left phone numbers in contact</li>
  <li>Messenger browser, on the other hand, pulls the fbid of the user, but this fbid is not equal to the facebook id.
    Check out github.com/suphiyasin/ for messenger id finder shared there</li>
 </b>
 
 # How To Use Sender
 <b>
  <li>We used the "auto mail sender" phpmailer library.
sends the draft you wrote on the page where you set your mail setting to everyone.
  </li>
  <li>The "auto mail sender v2" page is the recommended place
You write as name:mailadress@mail.com and when you write hi [username] whats up to the draft, the mail will go like this. hi suphi whats up</li>
  <li>We used Hasokeyk's instagram library for "auto dm sender"
You enter your accounts as accountusername:password and write your draft and send it (name:username is not active at the moment)</li>
  <li>We used wali.chat api for "auto wp sender"
Register on the site and connect your whatsapp account, copy the incoming api and write your draft with your no list and press send
    note: for now you have to write little by little</li>
<li>Even though "oto messenger bas" is disabled now, there is a high probability that it will send you the id's that you sent a message to and received from m.me/username.
  With the facebook cookie, you need to enter your facebook id.</li>
